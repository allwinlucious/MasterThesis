    "Collaborative robots (cobots) are increasingly integrated into various industrial and research applications. Unlike industrial robots, these are lightweight and cost-effective and typically do not come with joint torque sensors. However, the need for joint torque measurements in cobots exists for collision detection, dynamic parameter identification, and force control tasks. Traditionally, torque estimation relies on motor current signals or dedicated physical sensors, such as optical sensors <cite id=\"71oa9\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17740253%2FJH2DWQ5X\">(Tsetserukou et al., 2006)</a></cite> or linear encoders that measure the deformation in an elastic body placed in the joint solely for this purpose <cite id=\"lcpqk\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17740253%2FE4Z54QIF\">(Kawakami et al., 2010)</a></cite>. However, these methods face significant limitations, including high noise levels in current-based measurements, the additional compliance introduced to the system, and increased costs for physical sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of dual encoders and harmonic drive transmissions offers a viable substitute for torque estimation. Joint torque can be estimated by measuring torsional deformation using encoders placed on both sides of the harmonic drive. This approach may provide an economical solution using the built-in harmonic drive transmission and dual encoders. However, this method is not without difficulties since precise modelling of various physical effects, including friction, gear eccentricity, and position-dependent deformations, is necessary to obtain accurate torque estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In robotic joints, the total torque can be divided into multiple components: some are lost to internal factors like friction and hysteresis, while others contribute directly to the system's dynamics, such as moving the robotic link. The torques required for these internal dynamics are generally understood and can often be modelled. Apart from these, an essential component of joint torque is the external joint torques. These torques arise from interactions between the robot and its environment. The estimation of these external torques are crucial for tasks involving physical manipulation and contact with objects or humans. Hence, this thesis will focus on estimating external joint torques rather than the total joint torque. \n",
    "\n",
    "This thesis aims to develop a virtual joint torque model using a data-driven approach that uses multiple sources of torque information, such as motor currents and deformation in harmonic drive transmissions measured with dual-encoders. This study aims to improve the accuracy of \"sensorless\" external torque estimation in cobots, enhancing their performance and utility in real-world applications."

      "abstract": "When robots cooperate with humans it is necessary for robots to move safely on sudden impact. Joint torque sensing is vital for robots to realize safe behavior and enhance physical performance. Firstly, this paper describes a new torque sensor with linear encoders which demonstrates electro magnetic noise immunity and is unaffected temperature changes. Secondly, we propose a friction compensation method using a disturbance observer to improve the positioning accuracy. In addition, we describe a torque feedback control method which scales down the motor inertia and enhances the joint flexibility. Experimental results of the proposed controller are presented.",
