    "In a robotic manipulator, the links are generally rigid bodies that form the robot’s structure, while the joints are the movable components that join two or multiple links. Joints can be  with an actuator (active joints), or without an actuator (passive joints).Joints commonly found in serial robots are usually prismatic or revolute. Each type of such joint adds one degree of freedom (dof) to the system: the joint position $d_i$ for prismatic joints or the joint angle $q_i$ for revolute joints. The entire kinematic structure is typically referred to as a chain, which can be of two types:\n",

The symbolic notation also yields a method for studying lower-pair mechanisms by means of matrix algebra; two examples of application to space mechanisms are given.",
