The aim is to transform a point P described by the vector i x i ∈ R 3 in frame RF i to coordinate frame RF i−1 .

    "This section lays out the theoretical groundwork for understanding the dynamics of serial manipulators. The derivation of  differential equations of motion for a generic open-chain robotic manipulator with $n$ degrees of freedom (dof) is done following the Euler-Lagrange Formulation. These differential equations form the dynamic model of the robot, describing the relationship between joint positions ($q$), velocities ($\\dot{q}$), and accelerations ($\\ddot{q}$) with the torques ($\\tau$) applied to these joints by actuators.\n",

    "This is an energy-based approach to derive the dynamic equations in symbolic form of a rigid multibody system. This approach provides a systematic way, independently from the coordinate reference frame, to derive the equation of motion. In order to compute the Lagrangian of the robot manipulator, denoted by $L$, the potential energy $U_i$ and the kinetic energy $T_i$ must be computed for each link $i$ with $i = 1, ..., n$.
