To understand how these transformations are derived, consider two reference frames, $\\text{RF}_{i-1}$ and $\\text{RF}_i$, with origins $O_{i-1}$ and $O_i$, respectively. Suppose there is a point $P$, represented by the vector ${}^{i}\\mathbf{x}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ in the frame $\\text{RF}_i$. The goal is to express this point in the coordinate frame $\\text{RF}_{i-1}$.

The set $\\text{SO}(3)$ consists of all orthogonal matrices with a determinant of +1, representing pure rotation matrices.\n",

    "The kinematic representation of a robot manipulator consists of multiple links connected by joints. The links are generally rigid bodies that form the robot’s structure, while the joints are the movable components that connect these links. Joints can be either active, with an actuator, or passive, without an actuator. Additionally, joints are commonly foound in serial robots are usually prismatic or revolute. Each type of such joint adds one degree of freedom (dof) to the system: the joint position $q_i$ for prismatic joints or the joint angle $q_i$ for revolute joints. The dof of an active joint can be controlled individually by a microcontroller, which relies on feedback from an encoder measuring the joint's position. The entire kinematic structure is typically referred to as a chain, which can be of two types:\n",

This approach provides a systematic way, independently from the coordinate reference frame, to derive the equation of motion.
