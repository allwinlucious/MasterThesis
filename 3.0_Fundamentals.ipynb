In order to provide a good torque estimate following Equation 3.8, it is essential to have a good model of the joint's friction. However, friction is very complex to model accurately and is affected by many factors such as joint velocity, temperature, load, etc. To model the frictional torque, many simplifications have to be done.

The symbolic notation also yields a method for studying lower-pair mechanisms by means of matrix algebra; two examples of application to space mechanisms are given.",

      "abstract": "Joint torque sensory feedback is an effective technique for achieving high-performance robot force and motion control. However, most robots are not equipped with joint torque sensors, and it is difﬁcult to add them without changing the joint’s mechanical structure. A method for estimating joint torque that exploits the existing structural elasticity of robotic joints with harmonic drive transmission is proposed in this paper. In the presented joint torque estimation method, motor-side and link-side position measurements along with a proposed harmonic drive compliance model, are used to realize stiff and sensitive joint torque estimation, without the need for adding an additional elastic body and using strain gauges to measure the joint torque. The proposed method has been experimentally studied and its performance is compared with measurements of a commercial torque sensor. The results have attested the effectiveness of the proposed torque estimation method.",

      "abstract": "Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.",

      "abstract": "An analysis of a conventional gear wheel shot with MPK methodology has been processed by many authors before. Harmonic gearbox systems are composed of rigid and flexible parts through which the torque is transmitted, thus generating power. The contact pressure is specifically distributed through more teeth whilst against conventional gearbox systems. Firstly, a design description of a dynamic calculation model of a harmonic gearbox system in the planar strain is analysed in this article, as well as the definition of each contact constraint between the rigid and flexible parts of these gear systems in respect of “GLUE” and “TOUCHING” contact types. The last part of this article deals with the force distribution analysis in the teeth with respect to the frictional forces in them. The graphical conclusions of this pressure on each tooth were made. This article mainly focuses on the analysis of the stress in a gear tooth of the harmonic gearbox systems, as well as the research of a special trajectory of the rigid and flexible entity in a solid circular spline of such gear systems.",

      "abstract": "For high-performance engineering systems, modelbased controllers are typically required to accommodate for the system nonlinearities. Unfortunately, developing accurate models for friction has been historically challenging. Typical models are either discontinuous and many other models are only piecewise continuous. Motivated by the fact that discontinuous and piecewise continuous friction models are problematic for the development of high-performance continuous controllers, a new model for friction is proposed in this paper. This simple continuously differentiable model represents a foundation that captures the major effects reported and discussed in friction modeling and experimentation. The proposed model is generic enough that other subtleties such as frictional anisotropy with sliding direction can be addressed by mathematically distorting this model without compromising the continuous differentiability.",

      "abstract": "Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.",
